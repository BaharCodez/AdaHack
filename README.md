# AdaHack
For our project, we decided to participate in the Blackrock challenge.
We made a game on a website, coded for in Python. 

Our code:
We imported yfinance library which is an open-source tool that uses Yahoo's publicly available APIs, and is intended for research and educational purposes. Yfinance allows for live tracking of the stock market so we can offer players the best and most accurate experience.
using yfinance we can obtain historical market data

The program takes in the user's choice of stock to purchase and the amount of money they want to invest, the start date of their purchase and the date they would want to sell the stock. This means that users can monitor that stock for an extended period of time, with the choice of how long in the history of the stock they'd like to monitor.

This allows users to have insight into financial history, which allows them to develop their skill of predicting the stock market and developing an eye for trends. Nowadays, there are obviously algorithms that forecast predictions, by this program we hope students will be able to develop this skill for themselves.
